# React Google Book Search
---
### Overview
- React-based Google Books Search app. This SPA (Single Page Application) uses [react-router-dom] to navigate, hide and show your React components without changing the route within Express. Using helper/util functions and React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches, this is a full MERN stack application allows users to save books to a database to refer to at a later date. Built with Node, Express and MongoDB, and React-Toastify for custom alerts.
